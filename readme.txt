We have developed the code in two parts:
 1. Frontend
 2. Backend

We have to run them both separately. This will be fixed in sometime.(Working on it)

 Run the following commands 

    1> Install virtual env: > python -m venv venv
    2> navigate to env: > env\Scripts\activate
    2.1> Install dependencies : pip install -r requirements.txt   
    3>Run fastApi server: > uvicorn app.app:app --reload
